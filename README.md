#Overview
The project focuses on developing and evaluating a neural machine translation system using Transformer models, a cutting-edge approach in natural language processing. Leveraging frameworks like TensorFlow, the system specializes in translating English text to Nepali, aiming to facilitate cross-language communication and comprehension. Key components include tokenization, numericalization, and the implementation of Transformer architectures, such as BERT or GPT, adapted for sequence-to-sequence translation tasks. Evaluation metrics like the BLEU score are utilized to gauge translation accuracy and coherence against reference translations. This project aims to advance translation quality through robust model training and evaluation strategies, contributing to the forefront of machine translation research and applications.
